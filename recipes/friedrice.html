        <h1>Chicken Fried Rice</h1>
        <p><img src="../img/rice.jpg"></p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chicken Fried Rice is one of the best weeknight dinners around! Itâ€™s a homemade version 
                of my favorite take-out classic. We all had that ham fried rice growing up but move over 
                ham because the chicken variation is 100 times better! </p>

            <p>The whole family will love this protein packed, hearty chicken and brown rice combo.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Brown rice</strong> - leftover rice from the day before works best</li>
                    <li><strong>Chicken breasts</strong> - I like to dice the chicken into very
                    small pieces about 1/2 to 3/4 inch, it makes the perfect size for fried rice</li>
                    <li><strong>Toasted sesame oil</strong> - this oil is very strong and a little
                    goes a long way as it adds tons of flavor</li>
                    <li><strong>Vegetable oil</strong> (or canola oil) - this is used for sauteing
                    (along with the sesame oil so you won't use too much of that and sesame oil
                    on its own has a low smoke point</li>
                    <li><strong>Frozen peas and carrots blend</strong> - I like to use frozen 
                    vegetables here to save time, but fresh will work too</li>
                    <li><strong>Green onions</strong> - feel free to add more green onions to taste</li>
                    <li><strong>Garlic</strong> - only use fresh garlic here for more flavor</li>
                    <li><strong>Eggs</strong> - you can add three eggs here to stretch the recipe
                    a little</li>
                    <li><strong>Low-sodium soy sauce</strong> - if you have regular sodium soy sauce
                    that will also work here, too</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </p>
